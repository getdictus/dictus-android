## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Front-load risk -- Compose-in-IME (Phase 1), foreground service (Phase 2), whisper.cpp native build (Phase 3)
- [Roadmap]: Phases 4 and 5 can run after Phase 3; Phase 5 does not depend on Phase 4
- [Roadmap]: UI designs from Pencil.dev arrive later -- architecture/engine phases proceed first
- [01-01]: Used Hilt 2.51.1 (plan's 2.57.1 not published in Maven repos)
- [01-01]: Used Compose BOM 2025.03.00 (plan's 2026.03.00 not yet available)
- [01-01]: Set JDK target 17 for AGP 8.x compatibility
- [Phase 01]: Used Hilt 2.51.1 (plan's 2.57.1 not published); Compose BOM 2025.03.00 (2026.03.00 not yet available); JDK 17 for AGP 8.x
- [Phase 01-02]: Used full package name in manifest android:name to avoid merger ambiguity
- [Phase 01-02]: Used Unicode escapes for special key labels for cross-platform source compatibility
- [Phase 01-03]: Used rememberUpdatedState for KeyButton callbacks to avoid stale closures with layer switching
- [Phase 01-03]: Set AccentPopup focusable=false to prevent stealing IME focus
- [Phase 01-04]: Used AccentHighlight for caps lock vs Accent for single-shift; added drawBehind underline for accessibility

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Compose-in-IME lifecycle wiring is not in official docs -- rely on community examples (Gist, Medium sources from research)
- whisper.cpp Android examples are poorly maintained -- plan for build debugging time in Phase 3
- Hilt DI in InputMethodService requires EntryPointAccessors, not @AndroidEntryPoint
